Then clone this repo to your local machine to get started with your own project.

### Your now ready to start the Demo
Ensure that you set MySQL to allow case sensitive table names.

Ensure your connection to mysql has a configuration file set. 

This should usually point to the mysql install directory's my.ini file.

From Workbensh choose Server -> Options File. Then set lower_case_table_names = 2 under the general tab.

Restart your mysql instance.

Run the two sql files to create the sample databases.

Ensure the table names are Cased properly.

To run the code:
* Navigate to the PenTestSQL\PenTestSQL folder.
* Run: 
  * dotnet restore
  * dotnet build
  * dotnet run --server-urls http://0.0.0.0:5000
